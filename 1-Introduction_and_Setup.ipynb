    "The goal of this repository will be to teach the basics of Quantum Linear Algebra at an undergraduate level in a hands on way. All code in this repository will have parameters to change along with explanations to padagogically explain quantum algorithms in an intuitive sense. This repository is written as a supplement to the information contained in A Practical Guide to Quantum Linear Algebra (currently not published, but will be linked)."

    "This introduction is broken up into notebooks as follows:\n",
    "##### Introduction and Setup\n",
    "    This is the current notebook you are in which gives an introduction of the repository and a step-by-step walk through of how to set up this repository.\n",
    "##### Introductory Materials\n",
    "    This notebook provides an introduction to the fundamentals of quantum computing, covering the principles of qubits, visualization of qubit states, the intricacies of quantum measurement, and their connection to the classical eigenvalue problem.\n",
    "##### Hadamard Test (HT)\n",
    "    In this section, we present the Hadamard test (HT), a simple quantum circuit designed to estimate eigenvalues.\n",
    "##### Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) \n",
    "    Before we can explore more advanced algorithms, it's essential to understand the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) $-$ a key component in many quantum algorithms. The QFT is the quantum analogue of the classical discrete Fourier transform, and it plays a central role in refining phase estimation by enabling efficient extraction of eigenvalue phases.\n",
    "##### Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)\n",
    "    With a solid understanding of the QFT, we then introduce quantum phase estimation (QPE). This algorithm leverages the QFT to accurately extract eigenvalues.\n",
    "##### Quantum Phase Estimation verses Hadamard Test\n",
    "    Having explored two distinct methods for phase estimation, we compare their techniques and evaluate their relative advantages.\n",
    "##### Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM)\n",
    "    With a solid foundation in phase estimation, we can now apply these techniques to a real-world example: the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM)."
